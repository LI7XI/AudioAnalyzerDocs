## Getting Started

We will go through the steps of creating a skin, then we will explain what each option and its parameters does, and how you can use them.

Also we will share some tips about the plugin, performance and rainmeter in general.

?>We created a tutorial for each example, to see how they are made, read the documentation then go to [this](/docs/usage-examples/usage-examples.md) page.
