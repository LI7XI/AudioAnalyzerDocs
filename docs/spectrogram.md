## Spectrogram

[Image](Image)

This plugin can draw fancy spectrograms (don't confuse them with spectrum meters).
Spectrogram is an image of how spectrum of the sound has changes over a period of time.
It generates an image file on you drive 60 times per second (well, it is optimized not to write when there are no changes), so if you care about your SSD life you probably want to create some small RAM-drive and put it there using 'folder' property of the spectrogram sound handler.

"Bugs & Feature Suggestions" forum is always open for you complaints about how Rainmeter plugins can't transfer pictures directly to Rainmeter, without writing them on drive first. If you are a C++ developer and you know some hacks about directly modifying skins to show pictures, your pull requests are also welcome.
