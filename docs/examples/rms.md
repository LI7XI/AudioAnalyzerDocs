Similar to AudioLevel, RMS is a way of calculating the average of values over a period of time, using the mathematical algorithm Root Mean Square.

The signal value (amplitude) is squared, averaged over a period of time, then the square root of the result is calculated. The result is a value, that when squared, is related (proportional) to the effective power of the signal.
