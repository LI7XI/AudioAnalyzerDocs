## RMS, Peak and Loudness

<div><video src="docs/examples/resources/rms-peak-loudness.mp4" autoplay loop muted title="RMS, Peak and Loudness"></video></div>

This example is used to show you the difference between RMS, Peak and loudness.

<span style="color: #e0ac4c;" >Orange</span> line is Loudness.<br/>
<span style="color: #72efa4;" >Green</span> line is Peak.<br/>
<span style="color: #54c0ea;" >Blue</span> line is RMS.

You may notice that Loudness looks so different, that's because it's using a `Like-a` filter.
