## Spectrum

A sound spectrum displays the different frequencies present in a sound.

Most sounds are made up of a complicated mixture of vibrations. If you are reading this on the web, you can probably hear the sound of the fan in your computer, perhaps the sound of the wind outside, the rumble of traffic - or perhaps you have some music playing in the background, in which case there is a mixture of high notes and low notes, and some sounds (such as drum beats and cymbal crashes) which have no clear pitch.

A sound spectrum is a representation of a sound – usually a short sample of a sound – in terms of the amount of vibration at each individual frequency. It is usually presented as a graph of either power or pressure as a function of frequency. The power or pressure is usually measured in decibels and the frequency is measured in vibrations per second (or hertz, abbreviation Hz) or thousands of vibrations per second (kilohertz, abbreviation kHz). You can think of the sound spectrum as a sound recipe: take this amount of that frequency, add this amount of that frequency etc until you have put together the whole, complicated sound.
