## Usage Examples

In this discussion we will show you how to create skins using the available handler types.

We will assume that you already know what parameters each type has, so if we mentioned something that is unclear for you, simply refer to the documentation.<br/>
But don't worry, the examples we used are relatively easy and you will get them from first try.

?>Note that there is no right or wrong way of doing things, we will just show you how we do it.<br/>
Feel free to explore and create the skins in the way you like. Be Creative. <small>:star2:</small>

All examples we done here are available in the [.rmskin]() file.
