## Examples

Here are some examples on how to combine the [parent]() and [child]() measures in any way you prefer.

Including:

- usage of multiple processes in one parent measure.
- use different handlers in different child measures.
- use child measure to obtain infos about audio device(after documenting section variables and `InfoRequest` option).

_WIP._
