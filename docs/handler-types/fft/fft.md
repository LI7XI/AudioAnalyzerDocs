## Fourier Transform

Fourier Transform of the signal. Gives you values of frequencies from 0 to SamplingRate/2 (=Nyquist frequency).

Should always be used with Band handler. You can get values directly from FFT but that doesn't make much sense: there is a variable number of resulting values, which is difficult to manage in skin.

_Todo: a full rewrite of this section._
