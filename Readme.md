# AudioAnalyzer Plugin Docs.

You can view them [here](https://li7xi.github.io/AudioAnalyzerDocs/).

## Examples

There is a second branch called [examples](https://github.com/LI7XI/AudioAnalyzerDocs/tree/Examples), it contains all the examples we made in the docs.

## Preview

Simply fork this repo, install [Docsify cli](https://docsifyjs.netlify.app/#/quickstart?id=quick-start), then run `docsify serve` in terminal.

If you are using vscode, you can use live server extension instead.
